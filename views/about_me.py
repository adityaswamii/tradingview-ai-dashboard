st.markdown("""Hi! I'm Aditya Swami, a Computer Science undergraduate at Krea University with a strong foundation in logic, programming languages, and data-driven systems. My academic work includes a research internship where I formalized Dilworthâ€™s Theorem using Isabelle, resulting in a published entry in the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs. This experience deepened my appreciation for formal correctness, precision, and clean designâ€”principles I aim to bring into every project I build.

This dashboard was created as part of the LLM/Python Developer Internship assessment for IndianCapital. It combines multiple layers of real-world financial data using TradingView's Lightweight Charts and Streamlit, integrating OHLCV data visualization with direction markers, dynamic support/resistance bands, and an AI-powered chatbot using the Gemini API. The goal was to not only present the data effectively, but also make it explorable and insightful.

While developing this, I enjoyed the challenge of translating financial logic into responsive visuals and layered interactionsâ€”bridging my interests in systems thinking, data visualization, and AI interfaces. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to contribute to teams like IndianCapital that sit at the intersection of fintech, data, and user-centric engineering.
