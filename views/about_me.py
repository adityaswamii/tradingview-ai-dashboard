st.markdown("""Hi! I'm Aditya Swami, a Computer Science undergraduate at Krea University with a strong foundation in logic, programming languages, and data-driven systems. My recent academic work includes a research internship where I formalized Dilworthâ€™s Theorem using Isabelle, resulting in a published entry in the Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs ([here](https://isa-afp.org/entries/Dilworth.html)). This experience deepened my appreciation for formal correctness, precision, and clean designâ€”principles I aim to bring into every project I build.

This dashboard was created as part of an LLM/Python Developer Internship assessment for IndianCapital. It combines multiple layers of real-world financial data using TradingView's Lightweight Charts and Streamlit, integrating OHLCV data visualization with direction markers, dynamic support/resistance bands, and an AI-powered chatbot using the Gemini API. The goal was to not only present the data effectively, but also make it explorable and insightful.

While developing this, I enjoyed the challenge of translating financial logic into responsive visuals and layered interactionsâ€”bridging my interests in systems thinking, data visualization, and AI interfaces. Working on the chatbot in particular helped me better understand how to structure domain-specific queries and responses using LLMs, and how to integrate natural language interfaces meaningfully into data-driven applications.
